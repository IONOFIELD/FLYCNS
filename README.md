# flycns: benchmarked spiking simulation of the Drosophila central nervous system

A leaky integrate-and-fire network built from the complete male fly connectome (Janelia FlyEM
MaleCNS v1.0: 166,700 neurons, brain and ventral nerve cord, released June 2026), held to
published circuit physiology by a test suite with numeric pass/fail criteria, null models and
ablation arms. Three circuits, one declared parameter set, no fitted gains. Every deviation
from the raw wiring is cited. Status: v0.6, September 2026. Results note: `RESULTS.md`.

## Launch

    ./fly

That is the whole interface: it activates the environment, loads your neuprint token from
`~/.neuprint_token`, and opens the menu. To run it from anywhere: `alias flycns=~/flycns/fly`.

First time, from a fresh clone (macOS or Linux, Python 3.10 or newer):

    git clone https://github.com/IONOFIELD/FLYCNS.git flycns && cd flycns
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    echo "PASTE_YOUR_NEUPRINT_TOKEN" > ~/.neuprint_token      # neuprint.janelia.org, account page
    ./fly

In the menu: **1** fetch the connectome (~5 min), **2** fetch sensory annotations, **4** run the
suite (~40 min). Then **16** for the 3D cascade with real morphology, **11** to stimulate a
sensory group and watch what fires, **14** for one neuron's skeleton and synapses, **6** for the
summary, **27** for the measured account of why feeding fails.

## What the suite reports (16/16 scored, seeds 0 to 2)

| circuit | stimulus | readout | scored criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| loom escape | 9 loom-sensitive LC types, amplitudes **measured** from Turner et al. 2022 | DNp01 (GF), TTMn, PSI | 1-2 GF spikes per response; response probability 0.5-1.0 with a Wilson CI; 10-60 ms latency; 1:1 TTMn relay at 0.8 ms; relay lost without the electrical synapse; rewired null silent; CNS quiet |
| auditory to GF | JO-A/JO-B at 150 Hz | DNp01 membrane potential | sound alone subthreshold; the drive is carried by the declared JON-GF contact; null silent; CNS quiet |
| feeding | gustatory afferents by anatomical subclass | proboscis motor neurons | each of MN9's excitatory second-order inputs drives it directly; MN9 silent on a rewired null; activity confined to the SEZ; motor rates < 100 Hz |

**Feeding does not reproduce sugar-driven extension, and the reason is measured.** MN9's input
is balanced to 1.4%; gustatory afferents contact its inhibitory relays about three times more
strongly than its excitatory ones; signed path products are negative at two hops and positive at
three to five, so the pathway is disinhibitory; a silent network cannot express that, and a
uniform tonic baseline that makes it non-silent destroys specificity and abolishes escape. Four
uniform manipulations were tested and all fail for this reason (`results/feeding/mechanism.json`,
menu **27**). Reproducing feeding needs cell-specific spontaneous activity, i.e. the
state-dependent modulation this model omits; Shiu et al. 2024 reported the same limitation.

Also reported, not scored: the effect of auditory drive on GF's response to a near-threshold
loom, at a working point calibrated per run. At 40 trials per arm the difference is
**statistically unresolved** (95% CI −0.33 to +0.23); `FLYCNS_A2_TRIALS=120` for a usable
estimate. Not applicable with this annotation: bitter suppression and Shiu's labellar-sugar
contralateral bias (MaleCNS does not annotate taste modality).

## Flight: monosynaptic drive works, disynaptic drive does not
A surrogate body drives the 413 wing and haltere campaniform afferents phase-locked at the 202 Hz
wingbeat, and the DNg02 descending flight command (Namiki et al. 2022) is added in a second stage.
Monosynaptic pathways behave as wired: steering motor neurons follow the sign of their input, b1
fires about 0.5 spikes per wingbeat, and DVMn lands in the measured 2 to 12 Hz band on average
across recruitment draws but not reliably in any one, because 65% of its afferent drive comes
from a single wing campaniform type, SNpp16. Driven alone, SNpp16 activates DVMn and no other
flight motor neuron, but it is not necessary for DVMn activity and its effect is amplified by
convergence with other afferents (`benchmarks/flight_snpp16.py`; both pre-stated checks failed,
reported as such). The downstroke
power motor neurons do not: DLMn c-f receives about twice DVMn's descending drive per cell, almost
all of it disynaptic, and no command rate puts both power pools in band together
(`benchmarks/flight_loop.py`).

## A general limitation, stated plainly
Four independent circuits fail for one reason. Three carry their output by removing inhibition:
taste to MN9 (signed path products negative at two hops, positive at three to five), the
canonical ON pathway (Mi1's largest input is L1 with 141,873 glutamatergic synapses; the ON
response is a double inversion), and AstA release (Pm3 is GABAergic, so activating it in a silent
network does nothing). The fourth, auditory input to the wing motor system, has the pathway in
the wiring (four hops via DNp02, DNp06, DNp11 and DNg108 onto the VNC premotor pool) but its
descending neurons never fire under measured loom drive, so there is nothing for sound to
modulate. A zero-baseline LIF cannot represent any of them, and a uniform tonic baseline does not
help: it destroys stimulus specificity and abolishes the escape response. Cell-specific
spontaneous activity is the single missing ingredient behind all three. It is measured for at
least one motor pool (Azevedo et al. 2020) and for the feeding circuit's key modulator, TH-VUM
(1 Hz fed, 25 Hz starved; Marella et al. 2012), but **MaleCNS v1.0 contains no identifiable
aminergic modulator in the SEZ**: no dopaminergic or octopaminergic neuron has even 20% of its
synapses in SEZ compartments, and none of the 862 output-dominated midline SEZ bodies is
dopamine-predicted (`fit/check_modulators.py`). `benchmarks/feeding_mechanism.py`,
`benchmarks/peptide_asta.py` and `benchmarks/auditory_wing_trace.py` document three of the four
in detail.

## Robustness

- Escape is **invariant** to cord single-neuron parameters: sweeping tau_m 5-40 ms, threshold gap
  4-10 mV and refractory 1-5 ms across all 14,153 nerve-cord neurons leaves every check passing
  and every metric unchanged (`benchmarks/sensitivity_cord.py`). The inherited central-brain
  parameters are a limitation for circuits that require cord computation, not for this one.
- Escape passes 8/8 **unchanged** when every neuron whose per-T-bar transmitter predictions
  disagree with its aggregate label is sign-inverted (132,680 edges, 2.0% of synaptic weight):
  the circuit does not rest on any uncertain transmitter call.
- Transmitter signing overall: mean per-synapse confidence 0.91 over the 173,308 annotated
  neurons; 1.2% of neurons below 0.6; neurons whose T-bars disagree with their label carry 3.5%
  of synaptic weight (`fit/synapse_nt.py`).
- Nine-suite battery under measured stationary input: seeds 16/16; 5% random NT inversion 16/16;
  10% costs one check (GF response probability); weight scale 0.30 and 0.35 both pass, with
  opposite failure modes at 0.25 and 0.40; **targeted NT inversion passes everything**.

## Declared parameter set

Shiu et al. 2024 LIF parameters (tau_m 20 ms, threshold −45 mV, rest/reset −52 mV, refractory
2.2 ms, synaptic tau 5 ms, delay 1.8 ms); chemical kick 0.275 mV × 0.3 (MaleCNS rescale, fitted
by sweep); GF spike-triggered adaptation 15 mV (smallest value satisfying von Reyn 2014's
constraints under measured tuning, `benchmarks/fit_gf_adapt.py`); proboscis motor neuron
adaptation 10 mV (sustained rates < 100 Hz), relay motor neurons deliberately not adapted
(TTMn follows GF 1:1, Tanouye & Wyman 1980); electrical synapses GF-TTMn and GF-PSI (1:1 relay,
0.8 ms) and JON-GF (calibrated to a 3 mV compound potential); the 679 EM synapses annotated as
chemical on the JON-GF contact removed when the electrical model is on, so the contact is not
counted twice; monoamines sign 0 by deliberate scope; regional and class gains all 1.0; no tonic
baseline. Full list with citations: `flycns/graph.py`, `REFERENCES.md`.

## Measured inputs

The loom stimulus uses per-glomerulus amplitudes and a trial-gain distribution extracted from
the public Turner, Krieger, Pang & Clandinin 2022 dataset (Dryad doi:10.5061/dryad.h44j0zpp8;
10 flies, 150 loom trials): LC17 1.00, LC12 0.75, LC26 0.74, LPLC2 0.69, LPLC1 0.51, LC4 0.50,
LC16 0.49, LC6 0.40, small-object types 0.29-0.37. Trials are split by the authors' own walking
classification (no video download needed): responses are larger when the fly walks (LC6 0.64 vs
0.40 stationary; gain sigma 0.44 vs 0.36), reproducing their locomotor-enhancement result. The
benchmarks use the **stationary** set, matching a simulation with no locomotion;
`FLYCNS_LOOM_STATE=walking|all` selects the others. Menu **21** gives download
instructions (Dryad blocks scripted downloads), **22** runs the extraction
(`fit/extract_turner_loom.py`). The dF/F-to-rate scale (5 Hz for the strongest type) is the one
remaining free parameter of the stimulus and is declared as such.

## MaleCNS naming notes (discovered on v1.0)
- No sugar/bitter GRN split. Gustatory afferents are anatomical subclasses: `labellar bristle`,
  `taste peg`, `pharyngeal sensillum`. Driving all at once gives no feeding output.
- Shiu's FlyWire feeding names (Fdg, Bract, ...) do not exist; MN9's inputs are `GNG###`, `DNge###`.
- Sensory somas lie outside the CNS; side comes from the `_L/_R` instance suffix.
- Region membership is available per neuron from `roiInfo` (`fit/roi_membership.py`), which is
  what retired an earlier type-name-prefix definition of the SEZ.

## What this builds on and what it adds
A port and extension of Shiu et al. 2024 (Nature) from FlyWire to MaleCNS. The model, its
parameters and the feeding validation design are theirs; escape physiology from von Reyn, Ache,
Tanouye & Wyman, Allen, Augustin; the JON-GF synapse from Pezier & Blagburn; loom tuning from
Turner, Krieger, Pang & Clandinin. Added here: the test harness with numeric criteria and nulls,
one parameter set across independent circuits, a spiking sensory-to-motor cascade across the neck
connective on MaleCNS, measured stimulus tuning from public imaging, an uncertainty-targeted
perturbation, and a mechanistic account of one circuit the model class cannot reproduce. Where
the model disagrees with a measurement, the model is presumed wrong.

## Known limits
Single-neuron parameters are Shiu's central-brain values applied uniformly to brain and cord
(measured to be irrelevant for the escape benchmark, see Robustness; `CORD_PARAMS` in
`flycns/graph.py` is an empty stub for values read from Azevedo et al. 2020);
no parameter is fitted to a neural recording (only the stimulus is measured); modulatory
transmitters are omitted, which is exactly what the feeding result implicates; gap junctions
appear only where documented.
