# What is measured (Azevedo et al. 2020, eLife 9:e56754, tibia flexor motor neurons, Fig. 3):
#   input resistance   fast 150 MOhm (n=15), intermediate 300 MOhm (n=11), slow 700 MOhm (n=14)
#   resting potential, spontaneous rate, soma/neurite/axon diameter all covary along the same
#   gradient; slow MNs fire spontaneously at tens of Hz, fast MNs are silent (Fig. 3C-E).
#
# Why these are NOT entered here:
#  1. tau_m = R * C and the paper reports R but not membrane capacitance or area, so the time
#     constant is not derivable from the measurement.
#  2. The defensible use of the gradient is a postsynaptic gain proportional to input resistance
#     (the same synaptic current depolarises a slow MN ~4.7x more than a fast one), but that
#     needs a fast/intermediate/slow assignment for MaleCNS motor neurons. None exists: Azevedo
#     et al. 2024 (Nature) identified leg MNs by muscle target in FANC, a different dataset.
#  3. Current injection in fast and intermediate MNs failed to evoke spikes from the soma
#     because the spike initiation zone is electrically isolated from it (Azevedo 2020, citing
#     Sasaki and Burrows 1998). A single-compartment cell with a somatic threshold cannot
#     represent that; it is a limitation of the model class, not a parameter to tune.
#
# benchmarks/sensitivity_cord.py measured the escape benchmark to be invariant to cord tau_m
# (5-40 ms), threshold gap (4-10 mV) and refractory period (1-5 ms) across all 14,153 cord
# neurons, so this gap does not affect present results. Fill this in only alongside a
# fast/slow assignment for MaleCNS MNs, with a figure reference per field.
